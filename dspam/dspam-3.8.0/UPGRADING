Follow the steps sequentially from the base version you are running up to
the top.

UPGRADING FROM 3.6
------------------

1. Add 'Tokenizer' setting to dspam.conf
   The 'Tokenizer' setting in 3.8.0 replaces tokenizer definitions in the 
   "Feature" clause of previous version configurations. See src/dspam.conf
   (after make) for more information about this seting.
 
2. Check calls to dspam_logrotate
   Earlier versions of 3.6 did not prepend a leading "-l" flag to specifying
   log file selection. This is now required.

3. Ensure 3.6.0 malaligned hash databases are converted
   Version 3.6.0 failed to align hash databases to 8-byte boundaries. If you
   are upgrading from v3.6.0 and are using the hash_drv storage driver, you
   should run cssconvert to upgrade your .css files to a fully aligned format.

4. Invert "SupressWebStats" setting in dspam.conf
   SupressWebStats has been changed to simply WebStats, and the setting is
   inverted. Be sure to update this in dspam.conf.

5. Add "ProcessorURLContext" setting in dspam.conf
   ProcessorURLContext has been added to toggle whether URL specific tokens
   are created in the tokenizer process. The "on" value is default for previous
   versions of DSPAM.

UPGRADING FROM 3.4
------------------

Follow all of the steps above, and the following steps:

1. Add "ProcessorBias" setting to dspam.conf
   ProcessorBias has been added to dspam.conf and must be specified.
   Since ProcessorBias is the default behavior for previous versions of DSPAM,
   you will need to add "ProcessorBias on" to dspam.conf. If you have
   specifically disabled bias, or are using a technique such as Markovian
   discrimination, you may leave this feature off.

2. Ensure references to SBLQueue are changed to RABLQueue.
   Older versions of DSPAM used the SBLQueue setting to write files for a 
   DSPAM SBL setup. This has been renamed to RABLQueue. Please change this in 
   dspam.conf if you are writing to a SBL/RABL installation.

3. Add "TestConditionalTraining" setting to dspam.conf
   TestConditionalTraining has been added to dspam.conf and must be specified
   to be enabled. Since TestConditionalTraining is the default behavior
   in DSPAM, it is strongly recommended that you add 
   "TestConditionalTraining on" to dspam.conf

4. Ensure PostgreSQL installation have a lookup_tokens function
   PostgreSQL systems running v8.0+ must create the function lookup_tokens
   added to pgsql_objects.sql. The driver now checks your version and uses this
   function to improve performance on 8.0+.

5. Ensure you are specifying the correct storage driver.
   hash_drv is now the new default storage driver. hash_drv has no dependencies
   and is extremely fast/efficient. If you're not familiar with it, you should
   check out the readme. If you were previously using SQLite, you will now need
   to specify it as the storage driver: --with-storage-driver=sqlite_drv

   NOTE: Berkeley DB drivers (libdb3_drv, libdb4_drv) are deprecated and have
         been removed from the build. You will need to select an alternative
         storage driver in order to upgrade.
