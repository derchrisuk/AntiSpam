.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B dspam_train
is used to train and test a corpus of mail (in maildir format). This 
tool will present each message to dspam for a classification and then
retrain only if the message was incorrect. This provides close to real-world
training and should be used to build pretrained databases. Upon execution,
the tool will automatically determine the ratio of spam:nonspam and train
based on that ratio to ensure both corpora are trained consecutively. This
tool can also be used as a test jig to measure the efficiency and accuracy
of a particular corpus against dspam in a given configuration.
