ABOUT

  Serotype is the software platform which powers Six Apart's TypePad AntiSpam
  service. It is API compatible with the Akismet service, so the numerous
  Akismet plugins already available for blog and CMS platforms can be used with
  Serotype just by changing the server. The core engine (this package) is
  available under the GPLv2 for those users who would like detailed control
  over their setup and/or have highly specialized content which isn't properly
  classified in a public, shared data set.

INSTALLING

  See INSTALL.
