TypePad AntiSpam

TypePad AntiSpam is a plugin that transparently integrates Movable
Type's junk handling capabilities with Six Apart's collaborative
spam blocking service.

REQUIREMENTS

TypePad AntiSpam requires a valid API key. The plugin's system
configuration screen provides a link for obtaining an API
key.

TypePad AntiSpam requires Movable Type 3.2 or higher. It requires
a few external modules from CPAN that have been packaged
along with this plugin. These modules are:

* Class::Accessor which is included 
* libwww-perl (LWP) library which ships with MT

INSTALLATION

1. Download and unpack the latest TypePad AntiSpam distribution file.

2. Move the files into place.

Where /path/to/mt is the Movable Type application directory, transfer 
the contents of the following distribution directories to

  plugins    -> mt/plugins

DO NOT replace these directories in MT as they are likely
to contain other files that your system and other plugins
need.

NOTICE: TypePad AntiSpam will take advantage of background
processing if it is enabled on your system and is highly
recommended.
